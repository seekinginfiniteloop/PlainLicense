# Legal Contributions to Plain License

We highly value the expertise of legal professionals in ensuring the quality and reliability of Plain License. This guide outlines how attorneys and law-ninjas can contribute their knowledge and skills to our project.

## License Contributions and Reviews

### Identifying Legal Flaws or Weaknesses

If you believe you've identified a potential legal flaw in any of our licenses:

1.  Submit a new [legal flaw issue][legalissue].
2.  Click on "New Issue".
3.  Use the title format: "Legal Concern: [License Name] - Brief Description"
4.  In the body, provide:
   - A clear explanation of the potential flaw
   - The potential implications of this flaw
   - Any suggested corrections or improvements
5.  Label the issue with "legal" and "critical" tags.

We take these reports seriously and will review them promptly.

### Offering Legal Opinions

For general legal opinions or discussions about our licenses:

1. Visit our [GitHub "Attorney Talk" Discussions page][discussions].
2. Start a new discussion.
3. Clearly state the license you're discussing and your thoughts and opinions.
4. Encourage dialogue by asking questions or suggesting areas for further review.

**We encourage robust debate and critical analysis of our licenses.** Your insights help us ensure our licenses are as legally sound as possible.

## Challenging Our Licenses

We welcome legal professionals to critically examine our licenses. If you see potential issues or areas for improvement:

1. Review the license carefully.
2. Consider edge cases and potential misinterpretations.
3. Analyze how the license might interact with different jurisdictions' laws.
4. Share your findings through either the [Issues][legalissue] (for clear flaws) or [Discussions][discussions] (for general concerns or suggestions) as outlined above.

Your efforts to "rip apart" our licenses contribute significantly to their robustness and reliability.
