# Contributing to Plain License: A Beginner's Guide

We're excited that you want to contribute to Plain License! This guide will help you get started, whether you're new to open source or an experienced developer.

## Ways to Contribute

1. **Suggest changes or report issues**: If you have ideas for improvements or find problems, you can open an "Issue" on our GitHub page. This doesn't require any coding knowledge!

2. **Contribute directly**: If you're comfortable with Git and GitHub, you can make changes and submit them as a "Pull Request" (PR).

3. **Discuss**: Join our discussions on GitHub to share your thoughts and ideas.

## How to Contribute (Step-by-Step)

### For Non-Developers (Suggesting Changes or Reporting Issues)

1. Go to our GitHub repository page.
2. Click on the "Issues" tab.
3. Click the green "New Issue" button.
4. Describe your suggestion or the problem you've found.
5. Click "Submit new issue".

### For Developers (Making Direct Changes)

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your changes.
4. Make your changes in this branch.
5. Commit your changes with a clear message (see "Commit Message Format" below).
6. Push your changes to your fork on GitHub.
7. Go to the original Plain License repository and create a Pull Request from your branch.

## Commit Message Format

When you make changes, we use a special format for commit messages. This helps us track changes and update version numbers automatically. Here's the format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Types and Their Meanings

| Type | Use For | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `subs` | Big changes to licenses | `subs(MIT): Clarify liability clause` |
| `admin` | Small fixes to licenses | `admin(Apache-2.0): Fix typo` |
| `feat` | New features | `feat(site): Add license comparison tool` |
| `fix` | Bug fixes | `fix(build): Correct CSS loading issue` |
| `content` | Website content changes | `content(docs): Update FAQ` |
| `blog` | Blog post updates | `blog(weekly): Add post about open source` |

For changes to licenses, use the license name (like MIT or Apache-2.0) as the scope. For other changes, use the part of the project you changed (like `site`, `build`, or `docs`).
