# We Need Your Help... Telling People How to Help Us

Our immediate priority was to create a small set of plain language licenses that anyone could use. We will get around to finishing our documentation explaining how to contribute to Plain License soon. If you want to help contribute to our documentation, or in any other way, please [submit an issue][submit-issue] or [contact us][contact-us].

**We are planning contribution guides for** (and reach out to us if you want to help with any of these):

- **Crafting New Licenses**. We want to make more licenses available in plain language.
- **Translating Licenses**. We want to make our licenses available in as many languages as possible.
- **Translating the Website or Documentation**. We want to make our website and documentation available in as many languages as possible.
- **Improving Licenses**.
- **Providing Legal Feedback**. If you are a lawyer or legal expert, we would love to hear your feedback on our licenses and your suggestions for improvement.
- **Improving the Website or Documentation**.
- **Donating**. We are a small team (of one, for now) and we could use your help to expand our mission. We are planning to accept donations soon, and will start with raising funds to become a non-profit. If you have experience chartering `501(c)(3)`s, and you are willing to donate your time to help us with the process, please reach out.
- **Spreading the Word**. We want to reach as many people as possible with our mission to make licenses accessible. If you can help us spread the word, we would appreciate it.
