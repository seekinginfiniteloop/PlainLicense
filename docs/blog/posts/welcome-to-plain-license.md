# Making Licenses Clear: Welcome to Plain License

Have you ever tried to read a license and felt lost? You're not alone. Many people struggle to understand the complicated words and sentences in legal documents. **The Problem: Licenses Are Hard to Understand**

When licenses use complicated words and sentences:

- People don't know what they can and can't do with the work.
- People worry they might break rules they don't understand, and they worry about expensive lawsuits.
- Some people give up and don't use the work at all. A masterpiece might go unmade or unseen.

This stops people from sharing and working together. It slows down new ideas.

## Our Solution: Plain License Makes Terms Clear for Everyone

We created Plain License to solve this problem. We take hard-to-read legal documents and make them easy to understand. **We believe everyone should be able to read, completely understand and use licenses.**

## Why Clear Words Matter

Think about road signs. A clear "No cars" sign works better than a confusing sign with big words. Licenses work the same way. When you know what you can and can't do, you can create and share without worry.

## What We Offer

Here's what our licenses say in simple terms:

| License Type | What it means |
|--------------|---------------|
| [public domain]({{ ../..//licenses/public-domain/ }}) | "It's yours. It's everyone's. Do what you want." |
| [permissive]({{ ../..//licenses/permissive/ }}) | "Use it how you want, just say where you got it." (1) | { .annotate }
| [copyleft]({{ ../..//licenses/copyleft/ }}) | "Share your work the same way you got it." |
| [source available]({{ ../..//licenses/source-available/ }}) | "You can see it, but you can only use it for certain things." |
| proprietary (2) | "It's all mine." :nounproject-seagull: | { .annotate }
1. Usually. Some permissive licenses act similar to a public domain dedication.
2. Coming one day. We want to make proprietary licenses easy to understand too.

**We give you each license four (1) ways**: { .annotate }
1. We plan to offer other formats in the future, like html, pdf, and more.

- **Reader-friendly**: Easy-to-read text that uses style and color to help you understand
- **Markdown**: For easy copying to your project
- **Plaintext**: To copy to your project without any formatting
- **The original legal text**: For those who need it

## Our Goals

We focus on licenses for software and creative works for now. But we want to do more:

- We want to make every license easy to understand
- We want creators to feel confident about sharing their work, and make other people feel confident using it
- We want to make legal writing more accessible to everyone
- We want to push the boundaries of what licenses can do, how they are made, and how they are used
