# Making Licenses Clear: Welcome to Plain License

Have you ever tried to read a license and felt lost? You're not alone. Many people struggle to understand the complicated words in legal documents. **The Problem: Licenses Are Hard to Understand**

When licenses use complicated words:

- People don't know what they can do with the work
- People worry they might break rules they don't understand
- Some people give up and don't use the work at all

This stops people from sharing and working together. It slows down new ideas.

## Our Solution: Plain License Makes Terms Clear for Everyone

We created Plain License to solve this problem. We take hard-to-read legal documents and make them easy to understand. **We believe everyone should be able to read and use licenses.**

## Why Clear Words Matter

Think about road signs. A clear "No cars" sign works better than a confusing one with big words. Licenses work the same way. When you know what you can and can't do, you can create and share without worry.

## What We Offer

Here's what our licenses say in simple terms:

| License Type | What it means |
|--------------|---------------|
| Public Domain | "It's yours. It's everyone's. Do what you want." |
| Permissive | "Use it how you want, just say where you got it." |
| Copyleft | "Share your work the same way you got it." |
| Source Available | "You can see it, but you can only use it for certain things." |
| Proprietary | "You can't use it unless you pay or get permission." |

**We give you each license four ways**: { .annotate }
1. We plan to offer other formats in the future, like html, pdf, and more.

- **Reader-friendly**: Easy-to-read text that uses style and color to help you understand
- **Markdown**: For easy copying to your project
- **Plaintext**: To copy to your project without any formatting
- **The original legal text**: For those who need it

Our Goals
Right now, we focus on licenses for software and creative works. But we want to do more:

We want to make every license easy to understand
We want creators to feel sure about sharing their work
We want to see more new ideas because legal words don't get in the way
