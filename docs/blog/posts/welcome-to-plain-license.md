# Making Licenses Clear: Welcome to Plain License

Have you ever tried to read a license and felt lost? You're not alone. Many people struggle to understand the complicated words and sentences in legal documents. **The Problem: Licenses Are Hard to Understand**

When licenses use complicated words and sentences:

- People don't know what they can and can't do with the work.
- People worry they might break rules they don't understand, and they worry about expensive lawsuits.
- Some people give up and don't use the work at all. A masterpiece might go unmade or unseen.

This stops people from sharing and working together. It slows down new ideas.

## Our Solution: Plain License Makes Terms Clear for Everyone

We created Plain License to solve this problem. We take hard-to-read legal documents and make them easy to understand. **We believe everyone should be able to read and understand licenses.**

## Why Clear Words Matter

Think about road signs. A clear "No cars" sign works better than a confusing sign with big words. Licenses work the same way. When you know what you can and can't do, you can create and share without worry.

## What We Offer

Here's what our licenses say in simple terms:
<div class="annotate" markdown>
| License Type | What it means |
|--------------|---------------|
| [public domain][publicdomain] | "It's yours. It's everyone's. Do what you want." |
| [permissive][permissive] | "Use it how you want, just say where you got it." (1) |
| [copyleft][copyleft] | "Share your work the same way you got it." |
| [source available][source available] | "You can see it, but you can only use it for certain things." |
| proprietary (2) | "It's all mine." :nounproject-seagull: |
</div>
1.  Usually. Some permissive licenses act similar to a public domain dedication.
2.  Coming one day. We want to make proprietary licenses easy to understand too.
<div class="annotate" markdown>
**We give you each license four (1) ways**:
</div>

- **Reader-friendly**: Easy-to-read text that uses style and color to help you understand
- **Markdown**: For easy copying to your project
- **Plaintext**: To copy to your project without any formatting
- **The original legal text**: If you need to see the original words

1. We plan to offer other formats in the future, like html, pdf, and more.

## Our Goals

We focus on licenses for software and creative works for now. But we want to do more:

- Mmake every license easy to understand
- Make creators confident about sharing their work, and make other people feel confident using it
- Make legal writing more accessible to everyone
- Push the boundaries of what licenses can do, how they are made, and how they are used
