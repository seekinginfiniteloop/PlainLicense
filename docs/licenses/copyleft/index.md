## What is a Copyleft License?

Copyleft licenses are designed to keep open source works open source. **They allow you to do most things with a work, but you have to make your changes available to others.** Copyleft licenses are a great way to share a work while ensuring that it stays open source.

## When to Use a Copyleft License

You should **use a copyleft license if**...
**You want to**:

1. **Keep your work open source.** Copyleft licenses ensure that your work stays open source, even if others make changes to it.
2. **Require others to share their changes.** Copyleft licenses require that anyone who makes changes to your work must share those changes with others.
3. **Treat everyone fairly.** Copyleft licenses ensure that everyone who uses your work has the same rights and responsibilities. [Source-available licenses][source-available], for example may restrict certain uses or require payment for certain uses.

## Our Copyleft Licenses

### [Plain MPL][mpl]

The Plain MPL is a simple, clear adaptation of the Mozilla Public License 2.0. One of the key features of the MPL is that it is more compatible with other licenses than the GPL.

/// admonition | Caution: Our copyleft licenses may not be compatible with the original GPL, AGPL, or MPL licenses.
    type: warning

We designed our copyleft licenses to be simple and easy to understand. We try to capture the intent of the original licenses while making them easier to read, but **our licenses are not official versions of the original licenses**. Because copyleft licenses can be incompatible with each other, **we can't garauntee that our licenses are compatible with the original licenses or that people will recognize them as compatible.** If you have questions about how to use our licenses, we recommend you talk to a lawyer. If you choose to use one of our licenses, you use it at your own risk. The Free Software Foundation, and the Mozilla Foundation have not endorsed our licenses. We are not affiliated with them in any way. We are just people who care about plain language and open source licensing.

**If your work is for a specific community, you may want to use the original license instead of our version.** Our licenses are designed to be general purpose, and may not be suitable for all projects. You could also consider letting that community know about our licenses, so they can decide if they want to accept them. **We include a statement in our copyleft licenses that our license can be relicensed under the original license**, which should make it easier for people to switch to the original license if they want to or if they have compatibility concerns.
