# Coming soon

## ... but when?

Our priority right now is to get the core functionality of the platform up and running. We are also prioritizing permissive licenses over restrictive ones because they are in more common use. We will be adding more restrictive licenses in the future, but we don't have a timeline for that yet.

If you want to contribute to the project, you can help us by adding more restrictive licenses to the platform. We would love to have your help!
