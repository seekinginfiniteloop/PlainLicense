# The Plain Unlicense

### We Dedicate This Software to the Public Domain

**We dedicate this software and all accompanying documents ("the library") to the public domain.**
You can use it freely for any purpose and in any way you want. We give up all of our rights and interest in the library forever, making it public domain.

**You may**:

- Use the library for anything you want, in whole or in part.
- Copy, change, publish, distribute, or sell the library.
- Use the library for any purpose without restrictions.
- License any work you create with the library however you want.

**You do not need to do anything to use the library.** You do not need to ask for permission, give credit, or pay us. You can use the library without any restrictions.

### We Give You an Unrestricted License

Some governments do not recognize public domain dedications. For such cases, we give you a license to use the library worldwide. You never have to pay to use the library. The library is yours to use forever and cannot be taken away. Others can also use the library under the same terms.

### We Provide No Warranty and We Accept No Liability

We provide the library as is and provide no warranties of any kind, and we are not responsible for any damages or issues from your use of the library. You use the library at your own risk.

### For Legal Interpretation

If you are legally interpreting this dedication and are unclear on any part, you should interpret the library in a way that makes it as free as possible. If any issue remains unclear, you should use the official [Unlicense][unlicense-link] to clarify our dedication.
