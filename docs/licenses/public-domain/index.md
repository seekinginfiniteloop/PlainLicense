## What is a Public Domain Dedication?

Public domain dedications aren't licenses. Instead, **if you dedicate a work to the public domain, you give up all rights to the work.** This means anyone can use the work for anything and they never have to give you anything, including credit for the work. Public domain dedications are the most permissive way to share a work.

Some countries don't allow you to give up all rights to a work, so our dedications also include a fallback permissive license.

## When Should I Use a Public Domain Dedication

You should **use a public domain dedication if**...
**You**:

1. **Want to give the most freedom.** A public domain dedication gives everyone the most freedom to use your work how they want.
2. **Don't want anything.** If you don't want any credit or payment for your work, a public domain dedication is the way to go.
3. **Don't care about enforcing terms.** If you don't want to police how people use your work, a public domain dedication is the best way to share it.

## Our Public Domain Dedications

### [Plain Unlicense][unlicense]

The Plain Unlicense is currently our only public domain dedication. It is a simple, clear dedication that gives away all your rights to a work. **All Plain License content uses the Plain Unlicense unless otherwise noted.** (1)

1. Some licenses we recraft aren't in the public domain and require you give credit to the author, so we cannot release these under the Plain Unlicense.
