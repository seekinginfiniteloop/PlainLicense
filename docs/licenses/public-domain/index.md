# Public Domain Dedications

## What is a Public Domain Dedication?

Public domain dedications aren't licenses. Instead, **if you dedicate a work to the public domain, you give up all rights to the work.** This means anyone can use the work for anything and they never have to give you anything, including credit for the work. Public domain dedications are the most permissive way to share a work.

## When to Use a Public Domain Dedication

You should **use a public domain dedication if you**:

1. **Want to give the most freedom.** A public domain dedication gives everyone the most freedom to use your work how they want.
2. **Don't want anything.** If you don't want any credit or payment for your work, a public domain dedication is the way to go.
3. **Don't care about enforcing terms.** If you don't want to police how people use your work, a public domain dedication is the best way to share it.
