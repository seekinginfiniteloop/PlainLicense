description: The Unlicense is not a license. Instead, it dedicates your work to the public domain. Some places don't accept public domain dedications, so the Unlicense also provides a backup plan: a completely unrestricted license with no conditions. With the Unlicense, people can use your work however they want without any restrictions and without providing any acknowledging you.

how: Create a markdown file named `UNLICENSE.md` in the root (main) directory of your source code and copy the Plain Unlicense text into the markdown file.

# The Plain Unlicense

### We Dedicate This Software to the Public Domain

**We dedicate this software and all accompanying documents ("the library") to the public domain.** You can use it freely for any purpose and in any way you want. We give up all of our rights and interest in the library forever, making it public domain.

**You may**:

- Use the library for anything you want, in whole or in part.
- Copy, change, publish, distribute, or sell the library.
- Use the library for any purpose without restrictions.
- License any work you create with the library however you want.

**You do not need to do anything to use the library.** You do not need to ask for permission, give credit, or pay us. You can use the library without any restrictions.

### We Give You an Unrestricted License

Some governments do not recognize public domain dedications. For such cases, we give you a license to use the library worldwide. You never have to pay us to use the library. The library is yours to use forever and cannot be taken away. Others can also use the library under the same terms.

### We do not Provide Any Warranty and We Accept no Liability[^1]

We provide the library "as is." We provide no warranties of any kind, and we are not responsible for any damages or issues from your use of the library. You use the library at your own risk.

### For Legal Interpretation

If you are legally interpreting this dedication and are unclear on any part, you should interpret it in a way that makes the library as free as possible. If any issue remains unclear, you should use the official [Unlicense](https://unlicense.org/UNLICENSE) to clarify our dedication.
