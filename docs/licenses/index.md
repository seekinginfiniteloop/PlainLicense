    The opposite of licenses. When you __dedicate__ your work to the public domain, you give up all rights to it forever. Anyone can do anything with the work. *You can't dedicate your work to the public domain everywhere*, so most public domain dedications come with a backup permissive license.

    __[:octicons-arrow-right-24: make your work public][public-domain]__

-   :nounproject-copyright:{ .lg .middle } __permissive licenses__

    ---

    Permissive licenses allow you to do almost anything with the work, but you have to give credit to the original author.(1) They are the most popular licenses for open source software.

    1. Some permissive licenses don't make you give credit. They act more like public domain dedications.

    __[:octicons-arrow-right-24: free your work][permissive]__

-   :nounproject-copyleft:{ .lg .middle } __copyleft licenses__

    ---

    Copyleft licenses are both open source and restrictive. They allow you to do almost anything with the work, but you have to share any changes you make. __Copyleft licenses are a great way to share your work while always keeping it open source__.

    __[:octicons-arrow-right-24: keep your work open][copyleft]__

-   :nounproject-no-commercial:{ .lg .middle } __source-available licenses__

    ---

    Source-available licenses cover a wide range of permissions. The Free Software Foundation and Open Source Initiative don't consider source-available licenses open source because they restrict what you can do with the work. Most often they prevent people from using the work to create a competing product or service. They are different from proprietary licenses because they allow you to see the source code, but they are not as open as open source licenses.

    __[:octicons-arrow-right-24: keep out competition][source-available]__

-   :nounproject-proprietary:{ .lg .middle } __proprietary licenses__

    ---

    We call any license that doesn't let you see or change the source code a proprietary license.
    They are the most restrictive licenses.

    __:octicons-arrow-right-24: coming soon__ (1)
    { .annotate }

    1.  We prioritize permissive licenses over restrictive ones because they are in more common use. We will be adding more restrictive licenses in the future, but we don't have a timeline.
