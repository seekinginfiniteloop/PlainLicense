# Our Plain Licenses

Welcome to our plain license hub! We divide our licenses into public domain (dedications), permissive, copyleft, source-available, and proprietary.

[^1]: Sometimes these licenses are called "closed source", but that's not always the case -- some protective licenses are open source. The source code is openly available, and you can use it in many cases, but your use comes with restrictions. For example, licenses with restrictions against using commercial use fall into this category because they don't meet the Open Source Initiative's definition of "open source."

### [:nounproject-public-domain: public domain dedications](public-domain/index.md)

-   The opposite of licenses. When you dedicate your work to the public domain, you give up all rights to it forever. This means anyone can do anything with the work. However, not all places let you dedicate to the public domain, so we provide a backup permissive license in our public domain dedications. (1)

### [:nounproject-copyright: permissive licenses](permissive/index.md)

- Permissive licenses allow you to do almost anything with the work, but you have to give credit to the original creator. They are the most popular licenses for open source software.

### [:nounproject-copyleft: copyleft licenses](copyleft/index.md)

-   Copyleft licenses are both open source and restrictive. They allow you to do almost anything with the work, but you have to share any changes you make to the work. Because of this, copyleft licenses are sometimes called "viral" licenses because they can "infect" works that use components from a copyleft protected work, requiring you to license the new work under the same terms. They are a great way to share a work while ensuring that it stays open source.

    /// admonition | Do I need to license my new work under the same terms as the original work?
        type: question
    **Maybe.** It depends on the specific copyleft license and how you use the original work. We'll do our best to explain the details in each license.

### [:nounproject-no-commercial: source-available licenses](source-available/index.md)

- Source available licenses can cover a wide range of permissions. They are not considered open source because they restrict what you can do with the work. They are sometimes called "shared source" licenses. Some source available licenses are free to use, but others require payment or have other restrictions. They are different from proprietary licenses because they allow you to see the source code, but they are not as open as open source licenses.

///
/// define

### [:nounproject-proprietary: proprietary licenses](proprietary/index.md)

- Proprietary licenses fully restrict what you can do with the work, keeping all rights with the original creator. They are the most common licenses for commercial software and are sometimes called "closed source" licenses. We distinguish fully proprietary licenses from source available licenses because source available licenses allow you to see the source code, but proprietary licenses do not.
