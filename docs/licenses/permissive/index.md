## What is a Permissive License?

Permissive licenses are the most popular licenses for open source software. **They allow you to do almost anything with the work, but you have to give credit to the original author.** Permissive licenses are the most flexible way to share a work while still getting credit for it.

## When to Use a Permissive License

You should **use a permissive license if**...
**You**:

1. **Want people to use your work.** Permissive licenses let people use your work in almost any way they want.
2. **Want credit for your work.** People have to give you credit for your work when they use it.
3. **Don't care if people make money from your work.** Permissive licenses let people use your work for any purpose, including making money from it.

## Our Permissive Licenses

### [Plain MIT][MIT]

The MIT license is one of the most popular permissive licenses. It is a simple, clear license that allows you to do almost anything with a work as long as you give credit to the original author.

### [Plain Apache License][apache]

The Apache license is another popular permissive license. It is a simple, clear license that allows you to do almost anything with a work as long as you give credit to the original author. The Apache license is similar to the MIT license, but it has a few extra protections for the original author:

- **Patent Grant:** The Apache license includes a patent grant that protects the original author from patent lawsuits.
- **Contribution Provision:** It includes a contribution provision that clarifies that contributions to the work are covered by the license.
- **Trademark Provision:** It clarifies that the original author's trademarks are not covered by the license.
- **Notice Requirement:** It requires that anyone using the work must include a copy of the license, a notice, and a list of changes made to the work.
