## What is a Source-Available License?

Source-available licenses are not open source licenses (as defined by the Open Source Institute or the Free Software Foundation). They allow you to share your software (or other works) with others while keeping some control over how it's used. Source-available licenses can cover a wide range of permissions and restrictions. Some source-available licenses are free to use, but others require payment or have other restrictions. They are sometimes called "shared source" licenses. Source-available licenses are different from proprietary licenses because they allow you to see the source code, but they are not as open as open source licenses.

## When Should I Use a Source-Available License?

You should **use a source-available license if**...
**You**:

1. **Want to share your work.** Source-available licenses let you share your work with others while keeping some control over how it's used.
2. **Want to allow some uses but not others.** Source-available licenses let you set rules for how your work can be used. Most commonly, source-available licenses restrict offering the work as a service to others or prevent commercial use.
3. **Plan to charge for your work.** Some source-available licenses require payment for certain uses of your work. This can help you make money from your work.
4. **Want credit for your work.** Source-available licenses often require that users give you credit for your work. This can help you build a reputation as a author and get recognition for your work.

The Plain Elastic License is a source-available license that allows you to share your work with others, giving them freedom to use, share and change it. They can't offer a competing service based on your work. This license is for people who want to keep their work permanently out of the hands of competitors but still make it free for others to use.
