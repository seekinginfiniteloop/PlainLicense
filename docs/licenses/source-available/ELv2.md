/// details | About this License and Kudos to Elastic
    type: note

**We commend the folks at Elastic** for creating a license that's already clear. We've just made it clearer. You  worked hard to make your license terms accessible, and we appreciate it. Thanks for leading by example.

While the Elastic License (v2) has not been commonly used by other projects, our research found its terms were somewhat unique, standing between use-limited copyleft style licenses like the Server Side Public License and delayed open source licenses like the Functional Source License. Instead, the Elastic License more closely resembles a permissive license with restrictions on competition. We've created this Plain Elastic License (v2) to help more people understand and use it.

We identified other nearly identical licenses, including the Redis Source Available License (v2). They weren't as well known or plainly written.
