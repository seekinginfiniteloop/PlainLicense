# Plain License Proprietary Licenses :nounproject-copyright: :nounproject-no-commercial: :nounproject-closed-source:

## ... coming soon!

## When?

We prioritize getting the core functionality of the platform up and running right now. We also prioritize adding permissive licenses over restrictive ones because they are in more common use. We will be adding more restrictive licenses in the future, but we don't have a timeline.

If you want to contribute to the project, **you can help us by adding more restrictive licenses to the platform. We would love to have your help!** Get started with learning [how to contribute][contribute].
