-   ## __Get Clear Terms__

    ---

    :nounproject-understand:{ .xl .ecru }
    Get a plain language version of a popular license for your project. The [`Plain MIT`](licenses/permissive/mit/index.md "The Plain MIT License") is a great choice for many projects. We get the key points of the license and recraft them in plain language that's easy to understand.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: start now](licenses/permissive/mit/index.md "The Plain MIT License")

-   ## __Find the Right License__

    ---

    :nounproject-compare:{ .xl .ecru }
    Explore different licenses to see which will work best for your project. We love open source, but we know it isn't the right choice for everything. __We want *every* project to use terms people can understand.__

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: explore your options](licenses/index.md "Explore Licenses")

-   ## __In Your Format__

    ---

    :nounproject-formats:{ .xl .ecru }
    We offer each of our plain language licenses in multiple formats so you can get clear terms in a couple of clicks.
    You can get a plain language license in our reader-friendly [page view](licenses/permissive/mit/index.md#reader "The Plain MIT in our Reader View"), [Markdown](licenses/permissive/mit/index.md#markdown "The Plain MIT License in Markdown"), or [plain text](licenses/permissive/mit/index.md#plaintext "The Plain MIT License in plaintext"). We're working on more formats, so check back soon.
