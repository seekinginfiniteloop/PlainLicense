# FAQ

## Why do your licenses look different from the originals?  :material-chat-question-outline:

***We recraft licenses*** to make them easier to understand. We strive to capture the *intent* of the original license, and want to make the legal meaning as clear as we can. We prioritize accuracy and clarity. We will add graphics, tables, lists, or other formatting to make the license easier to read and better communicate its meaning. We may add or remove parts to improve accessibility. We also add an interpretation section, which is our way of making it clear to everyone that the license is a plain language version of the original.

## Can I use one of your licenses for my project?  :material-chat-question-outline:

Yes! Our licenses are in the public domain, so you can use them for any project. We want to make it easier for people to understand the licenses that cover their work, so we're happy to see our licenses used in the wild. You can change them however you like, and you don't have to give us credit. If you appreciate Plain License and our message, then please tell people about us.

While we believe plain language helps *everyone* (1) better understand your intent, **we can't guarantee that our licenses will work for your project or will hold up in court**. We're not lawyers, and we can't provide legal advice. If you have questions about how to use our licenses, we recommend you talk to a lawyer. You use our licenses at your own risk.

[Plain License itself uses our (un)license for Plain License's content](../licenses/public-domain/unlicense.md), and we hope you find our licenses useful for yours. We also welcome feedback to help us improve them, and *love* legal feedback to help refine our interpretations.
