# FAQ

## Why do your licenses look different from the originals?  :material-chat-question-outline:

***We recraft licenses*** to make them easier to understand. We strive to capture the *intent* of the original license, and want to make the legal meaning as clear as we can. We prioritize accuracy and clarity. We will add graphics, tables, lists, or other formatting to make the license easier to read and better communicate its meaning. We may add or remove parts to improve accessibility. We also add an interpretation section, which is our way of making it clear to everyone that the license is a plain language version of the original.

## Can I use one of your licenses for my project?  :material-chat-question-outline:

Yes! Our licenses are in the public domain (1), so you can use them for any project. We want to make it easier for people to understand the licenses that cover their work, so we're happy to see our licenses used in the wild. You can change them however you like, and you don't have to give us credit. If you appreciate Plain License and our message, then please tell people about us.

1. We use the [Plain Unlicense](../licenses/public-domain/unlicense.md) for our licenses, but some licenses, we recraft make you give credit to the creator. We will make that requirement clear.

While we believe plain language helps *everyone* (2) better understand your intent, **we can't guarantee that our licenses will work for your project or will hold up in court**. We're not lawyers, and we can't provide legal advice. If you have questions about how to use our licenses, we recommend you talk to a lawyer. You use our licenses at your own risk.

2. *Everyone* includes lawyers and judges, who *are* real people. We promise. :briefcase: :woman_judge:

[Plain License itself uses our (un)license for Plain License's content](../licenses/public-domain/unlicense.md), and we hope you find our licenses useful for yours. We also welcome feedback to help us improve them, and *love* legal feedback to help refine our interpretations.

## Is this another open source advocacy project?  :material-chat-question-outline:

**No.** We are a plain language project. We support open source licensing -- Plain License itself is dedicated to the public domain. We do not advocate for any particular license or set of licenses. We believe there are good reasons to license your work in many different ways and we think *everyone* deserves clear, understandable licenses. We want to help people understand the licenses that cover their work, no matter what those licenses are.

## What is plain language'?  :material-chat-question-outline:

Plain language is a way of writing that makes information easy to understand. It's not "dumbing down" or "simplifying." Plain writing helps make your message clear, so everyone can understand what you're saying.

Governments and people around the world are embracing plain language, and now we have an [international plain language standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/71632.html) that sets out the principles of plain language.

The Center for Plain Language offers resources to help you write plainly. You can get started with their [five-step guide](https://centerforplainlanguage.org/learning-training/five-steps-plain-language/).

Many countries have laws promoting plain language. In the United States, plain language is the law for government agencies to use plain language. The Plain Writing Act of 2010 requires federal agencies to write "clear Government communication that the public can understand and use." (3) We think that's a good idea for everyone, not just the government. [Plainlanguage.gov[(https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) is a great resource for plain writing.
