# FAQ

## Why do your licenses look different from the originals?  :material-chat-question-outline:

***We recraft licenses*** to make them easier to understand. We strive to capture the *intent* of the original license, and want to make the *legal meaning* as clear as we can. We prioritize accuracy and clarity. [We make changes to make the license as clear as possible](#is-anything-else-different-about-your-licenses--material-chat-question-outline).

## Is anything else different about your licenses?  :material-chat-question-outline:

**Yes**. We make a few kinds of changes with all our licenses:

-   **Style**. We make consistent style changes to our licenses for clarity and consistency. We use the following conventions:

    | Our Words | Legal Words |
    |-----------|-------------|
    | you        | licensee, recipient |
    | creator, we   | licensor, provider, author, developer, contributor |
    | the work  | licensed work, software, creation, covered work, library, materials |

    If a license talks about "contributors" as well as 'licensors' (or similar), we use 'contributors' to refer to the people who contribute to the work and "creator" to refer to the person who licenses the work.

-   **Coverage**. We strive to generalize the license to cover all types of works, not just software, which is why we use "the work" instead of "the software" in our licenses. We know that even if you're using a license mostly for software, it will probably cover other types of works too, like documentation or graphics. We can't cover every possible use case, but we try to make our licenses as flexible as possible.
-   **Formatting**. We use formatting to make the license easier to read. We use headings, lists, tables, bold, italics and other formatting to make the license clearer. We also reorganize the license and may add a summary of the license terms at the beginning of the license to make it easier to understand.
-   **Interpretation Statement**. We add an interpretation section to our licenses to clarify that the license is based on the original license and to tell anyone looking at it legally they can refer to the original license if they are unclear about the legal meaning of the plain language version.
-   **Compatibility Statement**. For copyleft licenses, we clarify that our version of the license is compatible with the original license and you can use the original license with the work if you want. We can't guarantee that our license will work with the original license, but we try to make them as compatible as possible.

## Can I use one of your licenses for my project?  :material-chat-question-outline:

**Yes!** Our licenses are in the public domain (1), so you can use them for any project. We want to make it easier for people to understand the licenses that cover their work, so we're happy to see our licenses used for real projects. You can change them however you like, and you don't have to give us credit. If you appreciate Plain License and our message, then please tell people about us.

1. We use the [Plain Unlicense](../licenses/public-domain/unlicense.md) for our licenses, but some licenses, we recraft make you give credit to the creator. We will make that requirement clear.

While we believe plain language helps *everyone* (1) better understand your intent, **we can't guarantee that our licenses will work for your project or will hold up in court**. We're not lawyers, and we can't provide legal advice. If you have questions about how to use our licenses, we recommend you talk to a lawyer. If you choose to use one of our licenses, you use it at your own risk.

1. "Everyone" includes lawyers and judges, who *are* real people. We promise. :briefcase: :woman_judge:

**Plain License uses the [Plain Unlicense](../licenses/public-domain/unlicense.md)** for most of its content, and we hope you find our licenses useful for yours. We also welcome feedback to help us improve them, and *love* legal feedback to help refine our interpretations.

## Is this another open source advocacy project?  :material-chat-question-outline:

**No. We are a ^^[plain language](#what-is-plain-language--material-chat-question-outline)^^ project**. We support open source licensing. Plain License itself is dedicated to the public domain, which is one of many ways to make a work open source. We do not advocate for any particular license or set of licenses. We believe there are good reasons to license your work in many different ways and we think *everyone* deserves clear, understandable licenses. We want to help people understand the licenses that cover their work, and we want to help people reading them understand what they mean -- that's it.

## What is plain language'?  :material-chat-question-outline:

**Plain language is a way of writing that makes information easy to understand.** It's not "dumbing down" or "simplifying." Instead, plain writing makes your message clear, so everyone can understand what you're saying. We believe that's important for everyone. After all, what is the point of writing something if your readers have to struggle to understand it?

Governments and people around the world are embracing plain language, and now we have an [international plain language standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/71632.html) that sets out the principles of plain language.

The Center for Plain Language offers resources to help you write plainly. You can get started with their [five-step guide](https://centerforplainlanguage.org/learning-training/five-steps-plain-language/).

Many countries also have laws promoting plain language. In the United States, the Plain Writing Act of 2010 requires federal agencies to write "clear Government communication that the public can understand and use." We think that's a good idea for everyone, not just the government. [Plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) is a great resource for plain writing.

## Aren't there enough licenses already? Isn't this just adding to the confusion?  :material-chat-question-outline:

**There are a lot of licenses out there, and that can be confusing.** We think that's a problem, especially when the licenses are hard to understand. For example, GNU's GPL (v3)mrequires [a very long faq](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html) just to explain how to use the license.

We think our licenses stand out because they're clear and easy to read. We hope that by making licenses easier to understand, we can help people make better decisions about how to license their work. We can't fix the problem of too many licenses. We can only offer our licenses as an alternative. Maybe one day we'll see a world where all licenses are written in plain language.

## Your licenses sometimes have a version number, and also sometimes have a version in the name (e.g. 'Plain Apache License (v2)). What's up with that? :material-chat-question-outline:

**We version our licenses separately from the original licenses.** We do this to make it clear when we've made changes to the license. We want to be transparent about what we've changed, so we version our licenses separately. We also version the name of the license to make it clear it is based on a specific version of the original license. For example, our version of the Apache License 2.0 is called "Plain Apache License (v2)" to make it clear that it is based on the Apache License 2.0. We always use this `(v2)` format to indicate the version of the original license we are using.

Not all of our licenses currently have an independent version. We are working on adding and automating this feature.

## How does your versioning work?  :material-chat-question-outline:

We use something close to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), but we don't follow it exactly. We version our licenses [separately from the original licenses](#your-licenses-sometimes-have-a-version-number-and-also-sometimes-have-a-version-in-the-name-eg-plain-apache-license-v2-whats-up-with-that-material-chat-question-outline), and we use the following format: `<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.

- **Major**: We increment to version 1.0 when we are confident the license is accurate and clear, and believe it is legally sound (as far as we can tell). Other major versions will be only if we identify and correct a significant error in the license that could affect its legal meaning or enforcement.
- **Minor**: We increment minor versions when we make significant changes to the license, such as adding or removing terms, or changing the structure of the license. We also increment the minor version when we make substantial changes to the style or formatting of the license.
- **Patch**: We increment the patch version when we make minor changes to the license, such as fixing typos, formatting errors, or other minor issues that don't affect the structure or meaning of the license.
