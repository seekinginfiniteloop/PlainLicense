# PlainLicense

**PlainLicense** is an initiative to rewrite popular software and creative licenses in plain, approachable language. Our goal is to make common licenses easy to understand for an average person with no legal background. We seek to recraft licenses in a way that is accessible, clear, and concise while maintaining the legal integrity and enforceability of the original licenses.

3. [X] Start of a faq

## Planned Features for Future Releases

1. [ ] More licenses
2. [ ] Sleeker UI
3. [ ] More detailed faq
4. [ ] whiz-bang hero landing page
5. [ ] Contributing guide for editing/writing or legal input
6. [ ] Contributing guide for adding new languages
7. [ ] Develop a standard graphic for simple license comparison
8. [ ] Templatize new licenses
9. [X] Automate license generation with a hook to simplify editing (so we're not editing multiple files for one license) [turns out this was really simple]
10. [ ] Implement per-license semver automation
11. [ ] Implement a license comparison tool
12. [ ] Eventually, generate your own license; modular approach with pydantic-like validation

## **Use at your own risk!**

Plain License licenses are provided as-is. Consult with an attorney before using any license for a project (and let us know what they say!). The creator, [https://www.github.com/seekinginfiniteloop/](@seekinginfiniteloop) is not an attorney. He's just a human who wants to make licenses more accessible for everyone.
