# BASE TEMPLATE FOR LICENSE PAGES
#
# This template is used to generate the license pages on the site
# Page structure is the same for all licenses, and is generated by the scripts
# You can edit the page structure in overrides/templates/license_template.jinja
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# TEXT FIELDS:
#      - Avoid using quotes in the text fields; instead use literal blocks (| for
#     multiline and > for single line with the text indented on the next line)
#
# Steps:
# 1) replace all {{ variables }} with the appropriate information
#     You can use find and replace to fill the variables in this template
#     Variables are: plain_name, original_name, spdx_id, original_url,
#     original_organization, original_version, category, license_description,
#     instructions, notes, intro, reader_license_text, official_license_text
#     (all in the format {{ variable }})
#
# 2) Remove tags that don't apply to the license for permissions, conditions,
#     limitations. These are from choosealicense.com's tagging system
#     https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com#license-metadata
#
# 4) Fill in the intro if needed. The intro field is APPENDED to the standard intro
#     text, so this may be empty. If you keep it empty, change the value to `null`. It
#     is empty on most licenses. Use it for unique
#    information about the license.
#
# 5) Fill in the reader_license_text and official_license_text fields with the
#   appropriate information. These fields are used to generate the license tabs on the
#   license page.
#     NOTE:
#         - **DO NOT INCLUDE THE TITLE AND VERSIONS FOR license text.** Start with the
#         first section of the license text. The title and versions are generated
#         automatically.
#         - Don't include an interpretation, not-legal-advice, or not-official section; #           those are generated automatically.
#
# 6) Save the file in the appropriate directory (docs/licenses/{{category}}/{spdx-id}}/# index.md. Don't worry
# about removing comments; we'll take care of that when we generate the license page.

# We use choosealicense.com's tagging system; we haven't implemented this yet, but we
# will in the future, which divides tags into permissions, conditions, and limitations
# SELECT ONLY TAGS THAT APPLY TO THE LICENSE, AND REMOVE THE REST
permissions: # AS APPLICABLE:
  - distribution
  - commercial-use
  - modifications
  - patent-use
  - private-use
  - revokable # this isn't in choosealicense.com's tags, but we need it because we have proprietary licenses
conditions: # AS APPLICABLE:
  - disclose-source
  - document-changes
  - include-copyright
  - include-copyright
  - network-use-disclose
  - same-license # must use the same license
  - same-license--file # must use the same license for the file, but not the project
  - same-license--library # must use the same license for the library, but not the project
limitations: # AS APPLICABLE:
  - liability
  - patent-use
  - trademark-use
  - warranty
# introductory text before the license tab interface, this is appended to the standard
# intro text -- optional. If you don't have anything to add, set to `null`

# Reader License Text -- can include mkdocs markdown
# Scripts will automatically generate the rest of the tabs, text, and links
# You SHOULD NOT include code blocks here; those are generated automatically
# You can use inline code spans, but not code blocks
# Don't include the header; it is generated automatically
# Don't use reference tags in the license text; use in-line links instead

# official license text -- try to use a standard markdown format
# This is the text of the original license, INCLUDING its header
# If the official license text is in a different format, check if it's at
# https://github.com/IQAndreas/markdown-licenses or convert it to markdown by hand
# (usually just adding header tags and fixing links). Reach out if you need help.
# Don't use reference tags in the license text; use in-line links instead
