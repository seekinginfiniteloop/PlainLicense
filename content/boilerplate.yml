interpretation_title: "**If you are legally interpreting this {{ license_type }}**"

interpretation_text: |
  If any part of this {{ license_type }} is not enforceable, the rest of the {{ license_type }} still applies. This {{ license_type }} is a plain language adaptation of the {{ original_name }} to improve readability and accessibility. If any part of this {{ license_type }} is unclear, you should use the official [{{ original_name }}]({{ original_url }}) to clarify our intent.

not_official_title: "**Warning:** This is not the official {{ original_name }}"

not_official_text: |
  Plain License is not affiliated with the original {{ original_name }} authors or {{ original_organization }}. **Our plain language versions are not official** and are not endorsed by the original authors. Our licenses may also include different terms or additional information. We try to capture the *legal meaning* of the original license, but we can't guarantee our license provides the same legal protections.

  If you want to use the {{ plain_name }}, you should refer to the original license text to make sure you understand how it might be different. You can find the official {{ original_name }} [here]({ original_url }).

legal_advice_title: "**WARNING:** This is Not Legal Advice"

legal_advice_text: |
  We are not lawyers. This is not legal advice. You use this license at your own risk. If you need legal advice, talk to a lawyer.

  We are normal people who want to make licenses accessible for everyone. We hope that our plain language helps you and anyone else (including lawyers) understand this license. If you see a mistake or have a suggestion, please [submit an issue]({{ github_base_url }}/issues/new/choose) or [edit it yourself]({{ github_base_url }}/edit/main/docs/{{ original_url }}).
