# BASE TEMPLATE FOR LICENSE PAGES
#
# This template is used to generate the license pages on the site
# Page structure is the same for all licenses, and is generated by the scripts
# You can edit the page structure in templates/license_template.jinja
#
# INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# Steps:
# 1) replace all {{ variables }} with the appropriate information
#     You can use find and replace to fill the variables in this template
#     Variables are: plain_name, original_name, spdx_id, original_url,
#     original_organization, original_version, category, license_description,
#     instructions, notes, intro, reader_license_text, official_license_text
#     (all in the format {{ variable }})
#
# 2) Remove tags that don't apply to the license for permissions, conditions,
#     limitations. These are from choosealicense.com's tagging system
#     https://github.com/github/choosealicense.com#license-metadata
#
# TEXT FIELDS: (for steps 4 and 5)
#      - use the yaml syntax for literal multiline strings (|) for the intro,
#       reader_license_text, and official_license_text fields, the key is followed by a
#       pipe (|), and all text must be indented by one level and starts on the next
#       line after the pipe.
#
# 4) Fill in the intro if needed. The intro field is appended to the standard intro
#     text, so this may be blank. It is empty on most licenses. Use it for unique
#    information about the license.
#
# 5) Fill in the reader_license_text and official_license_text fields with the
#   appropriate information. These fields are used to generate the license tabs on the
#   license page.
#     NOTE:
#         - DO NOT INCLUDE THE HEADER FOR READER_LICENSE_TEXT. The header includes the
#           plain_name title, and official and plain version numbers. Basically, start
#           with the substance. The header is generated automatically.
#         - Don't include an interpretation, not-legal-advice, or not-official section; #           those are generated automatically.
#
# 6) Save the file in the appropriate directory (content/en/spdx_id.yml). Don't worry
# about removing comments; we'll take care of that when we generate the license page.

plain_name: "Plain {{ plain_name }}" # don't include version number

original_version: "{{ original_version }}" # version of the original license e.g. '2.0' for Apache 2.0. 'null' if there is no versioning

# We use choosealicense.com's tagging system; we haven't implemented this yet, but we will in the future, which divides tags into permissions, conditions, and limitations
# SELECT ONLY TAGS THAT APPLY TO THE LICENSE, AND REMOVE THE REST
permissions: # AS APPLICABLE:
  - distribution
  - commercial-use
  - modifications
  - patent-use
  - private-use
  - revokable # this isn't in choosealicense.com's tags, but we need it because we have proprietary licenses

conditions: # AS APPLICABLE:
  - disclose-source
  - document-changes
  - include-copyright
  - include-copyright
  - network-use-disclose
  - same-license # must use the same license
  - same-license--file # must use the same license for the file, but not the project
  - same-license--library # must use the same license for the library, but not the project

limitations: # AS APPLICABLE:
  - liability
  - patent-use
  - trademark-use
  - warranty

# introductory text before the license tab interface, this is appended to the standard intro text
intro: |
  {{ intro }}

# Reader License Text -- can include mkdocs markdown
# Scripts will automatically generate the rest of the tabs, text, and links
# You SHOULD NOT include code blocks here; those are generated automatically
# You can use inline code spans, but not code blocks
# Don't include the header; it is generated automatically
reader_license_text: |
  {{ reader_license_text }}

# official license text -- try to use a standard markdown format
# This is the text of the original license, INCLUDING its header
# If the official license text is in a different format, check if it's at https://github.com/IQAndreas/markdown-licenses or convert it to markdown by hand (usually just adding header tags and fixing links). Reach out if you need help.

  {{ official_license_text }}

# list of reference links for the page (any link in format [text][reference_tag] will be replaced with a link if you define the reference_tag below)
# If you use a link or text that has a placeholder, use the placeholder (e.g. reference_tag: mit  link_url: {{ original_url }} link_title: {{ original_name }}).
# That helps keep the links consistent across licenses and minimizes changes when we update the site.

link_in_original: false
# boolean, if the original license includes a link to the original_url, set to true
# if the original license does not include a link to the original_url, set to false; we'll add a link to the license when we generate the page

reference_links:
  - reference_tag: null # reference tag for the link
    link_url: null # URL for the link
    link_title: null # title for the link -- optional, appears in a tooltip. We use the link text if you don't provide a title
