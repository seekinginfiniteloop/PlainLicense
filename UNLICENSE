# Plain Unlicense

Plain Version: 



### Legally Interpreting the Plain Unlicense

The Plain Unlicense is a plain language adaptation of the Unlicense. We made the
Plain Unlicense to make the Unlicense more accessible and understandable. We
tried to match the Unlicense's legal intent exactly. **If you think the Plain
Unlicense's terms are legally unclear, use the official  to clarify the terms.**

If a court finds that any part of this  cannot be enforced, the rest of the
will still apply.
