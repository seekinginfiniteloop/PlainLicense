## We Dedicate This Work to the Public Domain

**The authors ("we") dedicate this work ("the work") to the public domain.** You
can use it freely for any purpose and in any way you want. We give away all
rights and interest in the work to the public domain forever.

## You Can Do Anything with the Work

restrictions.

## We Give You an Unrestricted License

Some courts do not recognize public domain dedications. For such cases, we give
you a license to use and change the work worldwide. You and everyone else can
use the work forever and never need to pay to use it. No one can take this
license from you.

## We Provide No Warranty and Accept No Liability

for any damages or issues from your use of the work.

### **Legally Interpreting the Plain Unlicense**

The Plain Unlicense is a plain language adaptation of the Unlicense. We made the
Plain Unlicense to make the Unlicense more accessible and understandable. We
tried to match the Unlicense's legal intent exactly. **If you think the Plain
Unlicense's terms are legally unclear, use the official  to clarify the terms.**

If a court finds that any part of this dedication cannot be enforced, the rest
of the dedication will still apply.
