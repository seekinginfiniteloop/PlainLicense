### We Dedicate All Plain License Content to the Public Domain

**The author(s) ("we") dedicate this software and all accompanying documents ("the library") to the public domain.**
You can use it freely for any purpose and in any way you want. We give away all rights and interest in the library to the public domain forever.

**You may**:

- Use the library for anything you want, in whole or in part.
- Copy, change, publish, distribute, or sell the library.

**You do not need to do anything to use the library.** You do not need to ask for permission, give credit, or pay us. You can use the library without any restrictions.

### We Give You an Unrestricted License

Some governments do not recognize public domain dedications. For such cases, we give you a license to use the library worldwide. You and everyone else can use the library forever and never need to pay to use it. No one can take this license from you.

### We Provide No Warranty and Accept No Liability

We provide the library "as is" and provide no warranties of any kind. You use the library at your own risk. We are not responsible for any damages or issues from your use of the library.

### For Legal Interpretation

If you are legally interpreting this dedication and are unclear on any part, you should interpret the library in a way that makes it as free as possible. If any issue remains unclear, you should use the official [Unlicense][unlicense-link] to clarify our dedication.
